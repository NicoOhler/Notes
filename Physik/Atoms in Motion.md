### Fundamentals
+ all things are made of atoms
+ little particles which move in perpetual motion
+ attracting each other for short distances
+ repelling  upon too close squeezing together
+ ~$1-2 * 10^{-10}$ m in radius

### Case Example: Water
+ water drop does not fall apart due to its attraction
	+ may move from one place to another
+ particle motion = heat
	+ high temperature => more movement => molecules fly away => steam
		+ single molecules are knocked too far away such that the pull of the other molecules is no longer strong enough
		+ steam are water molecules spread far apart
	+ low temperature => less movement => molecules glued/locked => ice
		+ every atom has a definite place
		+ rotating one atom also rotates any connected atoms
		+ shrinks/expands depending on crystalline structure
			+ water and metals shrink
				+ open crystal structure has holes which collapses
			+ most substances expand
				+ closely packed in solid crystal
				+ melting => need more room to jiggle around
+ some water molecules fly away, some "outsiders" merge with others
	+ ratio between incoming and outgoing determines whether it evaporates or condenses
	+ reaches an q

### Pressure
+ molecules bouncing in a vessel
+ keep knocking on the outer bounds
+ requires an outer counter force 
	+ double density => twice as many molecules bouncing against wall => double force needed
	+ double speed => molecules hit harder + more often => more pressure
	+ $pressure = force * area$


### Compression
+ imagine a piston pushing inward a closed vessel
+ piston wall is like a ping pong paddle hitting the molecules and increasing their speed => hotter
+ expansion => colder

### Absolute Zero
+ temperature with minimum amount of vibration
+ but not zero
+ Helium does not freeze at absolute zero
	+ only known substance
	+ unless outwards pressure is also applied to make it solid

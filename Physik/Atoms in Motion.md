### Fundamentals
+ all things are made of atoms
+ little particles which move in perpetual motion
+ attracting each other for short distances
+ repelling  upon too close squeezing together
+ ~$1-2 * 10^{-10}$ m in radius

### Case Example: Water
+ water drop does not fall apart due to its attraction
	+ may move from one place to another
+ particle motion = heat
	+ high temperature => more movement => molecules fly away => steam
		+ single molecules are knocked too far away such that the pull of the other molecules is no longer strong enough
		+ steam are water molecules spread far apart
+ pressure
	+ molecules bouncing in a vessel
	+ keep knocking on the outer bounds
	+ requires an outer counter force 
		+ double density => twice as many molecules bouncing against wall => double force needed
		+ double speed => molecules hit harder + more often => more pressure
		+ $pressure = force * area$
+ compression and expansion of gas
	+ imagine a piston pushing inward a closed vessel
	+ piston wall is like a ping pong paddle hitting the molecules and increasing their speed => more heat
	+ inverse

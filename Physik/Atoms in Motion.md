### Fundamentals
+ all things are made of atoms
+ little particles which move in perpetual motion
+ attracting each other for short distances
+ repelling  upon too close squeezing together
+ ~$1-2 * 10^{-10}$ m in radius

### Case Example: Water
+ water drop does not fall apart due to its attraction
	+ may move from one place to another
+ particle motion = heat
	+ high temperature => more movement => molecules fly away => steam
		+ single molecules are knocked too far away such that the pull of the other molecules is no longer strong enough
		+ steam are water molecules spread far apart

+ your body language and signals/cues you send to other people influences them

### Key Concepts
+ exchanging single words can change how people react
	+ meeting -> collaboration
	+ group -> community
+ resting bitch face
	+ your default face sends signals (e.g., sad, angry, tired, ...)
	+ try to counteract those if needed
	+ what is your resting default?
		+ mouth, eyes, brows, ...
+ be authentic
	+ be actually happy/confident on profile pictures, CVs
	+ faking a smile is easy but ineffective
		+ others will perceive this negatively
		+ facial expressions around the eyes will not look natural
		+ smiling is not essential for charisma 
+ be likeable by
	+ being  confident
	+ liking others
	+ thinking that others like you
		+ do NOT think they do not like you
	+ using phrases like 
		+ "I was just thinking about you" (You are important to me)
		+ "You are always so ..." (I perceive you as positive)
		+ "Last time ..." ( I remember you)
+ success, motivation and happiness is contagious
	+ surround yourself with "high quality" people
		+ invest in the 5 people you spend the most time with
		+ they should make you motivated, feel better
	+ surrounding yourself with high-performers increases your performance
		+ inverse for low-performers
	+ physiological effect
		+ smelling sweat of fear makes you afraid/careful/tense
		+ smelling exercise sweat does not

+ hands are windows into the souls
	+ they show intention
	+ show your hands (palms in particular)
		+ hiding your hands makes others feel uneasy
	+ number of hand gestures 
		+ directly correlated to people
			+ believing
			+ caring
			+ paying attention
			+ engaging
		+ seem to matter more than intense facial expressions
	+ lying with hand gestures is hard
		+ liars use them less
	+ vocal variety increases with hand gestures
+ proximity zones
	+ best conversations in personal zone
	+ be careful about intimate zone (also in video calls)
	+ loud nightclubs => people cannot understand each other => move close => intimacy enforced

+ charisma = competence + warmth
	+ competent = powerful, reliable, capable
	+ warm = trustworthy, likable, friendly
	+ competent people need people to trust them
	+ warm people need people care/believe about what they say

+ signal amplification bias
	+ overestimating how well other can read you
+ power cues
	+ use if warm but not competent enough
	+ Merkel Raute
		+ signals competence and confidence
	+ distance between earlobes and shoulders => confidence
	+ eye contact at specific times 
		+ end of sentence 
			+ to drill a point
			+ not before to signal that you are thinking 
		+ when the opposite says something important
		+ too much eye contact (> 65%) feels invasive/territorial
	+ lower lid flex
		+ signals focus/paying attention/trying to understand
		+ look for lower lid flex in others (especially changes)
			+ do they have something to say?
			+ did you say/do something wrong?
			+ are they engaged? curious? sceptic? confused?
	+ vocal cues
		+ avoid accidental questions
			+ high pitch at sentence end
			+ especially when proposing something
			+ often used by liars
		+ use downward inflection
			+ lower intonation at sentence end
			+ signals that you are serious about something
+ warmth cues
	+ use if competent but not warm enough
		+ e.g., too intimidating
	+ slow triple nod
		+ signals "tell me more"
		+ too fast signals impatience

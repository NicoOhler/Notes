+ your body language and signals/cues you send to other people influences them

### Key Concepts
+ exchanging single words can change how people react
	+ meeting -> collaboration
	+ group -> community
+ resting bitch face
	+ your default face sends signals (e.g., sad, angry, tired, ...)
	+ try to counteract those if needed
	+ what is your resting default?
		+ mouth, eyes, brows, ...


+ success, motivation and happiness is contagious
	+ surround yourself with "high quality" people
		+ invest in the 5 people you spend the most time with
		+ they should make you motivated, feel better
	+ surrounding yourself with high-performers increases your performance
		+ inverse for low-performers
	+ physiological effect
		+ smelling sweat of fear makes you afraid/careful/tense
		+ smelling exercise sweat does not
	+ cue cycle
		+ reinforcing up/downwards spiral
		+ can be broken by labelling and understanding received/sent cues

+
+ signal amplification bias
	+ overestimating how well other can read you
+ subconsciousness is great at reading subtle cues
+ avoid awkward hugs/handshakes
	+ clearly signal your intention beforehand
	+ walk towards someone with 
		+ stretched out hand => handshake
		+ both hands => hug
		+ fist => fist bump
	+ good hugs
		+ no asymmetry
		+ no patting 
		+ smaller person puts hands up and vice versa
	+ good handshake
		+ thumb up
			+ palm up => submissive
			+ palm down => dominating
		+ do not pull
+ presentations/on-stage behavior
	+ walk intentionally to specific point to signal you know what you want
+ imperfections make likable
	+ drop the shoe
		+ share vulnerabilities and laugh off mistakes
		+ open up
		+ control what others think of you
	+ "What is wrong with you?"
		+ people will try to find out
		+ do not try to be perfect
		+ job interviewers rate people with small imperfections higher
	+ just do not go too far :^)
+ ambivalent relationships are mentally draining
	+ ambivalent = you do not know how you feel about them
	+ clearly knowing who you do not like is easier
	+ try to move ambivalent people out
	+ know them better => classify as good/bad
+ play to your social strengths?
	+ what do you excel at?

### Finite State Machines - Automaton

+ synchronous FSM clocked by clock signal and [[Clock Frequency]]
+ each clock period has defined current state
+ machine advances into next defined state after each rising edge

### State Diagram
+ defines sequence of states
+ initial state defined
+ circle with symbolic names for each state
+ arrows define sequence
	+ can be described in state transition table
+ may have inputs which influence next state

### Motivation
+ Flie√übandprinzip
	+ each component has own dedicated task
	+ invented by Henry Ford
+ pipeline the execution of multiple instructions
	+ assembly line of instructions
+ divide instruction processing into distinct stages
	+ different instruction executed each stage
	+ requires additional registers between each stage

### Example
+ four independent ADDs
	+ ![[Pasted image 20221112165103.png]]
+ laundry analogy
	+ compensate being slow on specific stage
	+ multiple instance of slow stage

### Ideal Pipelining

### Control Signals
+ signals piped through and used when needed

### RAW Dependence Handling
+ sometimes ressource needed by instruction only available later on
	+ e.g. 2nd instruction needs value from first

# Classification
### Overview
+ activity of deciding for given input x, to which class the input belongs
+ given input x, determine y=f(x)
	+ $yâˆˆ{y_1...y_n}$
	+ finite number of classes
+ typical [[Machine Learning]] task
	+ if classification rules are too complex

### Classification as Supervised Learning
+ given a set of example pairs $(x,y)$
	+ x input
	+ y label
+ each y generated by unknown function
+ we assume y is a function of x
	+ x might be parameters completely independent from y
	+ goal is to approximate

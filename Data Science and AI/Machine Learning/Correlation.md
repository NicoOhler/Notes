# Correlation and Regression
### Correlation
+ describes to what extent two variables are related
+ does not immediately mean causality
	+ e.g. correlation between shark attacks and ice cream sales
		+ shark attacks do not cause ice cream sales
		+ ice cream sales do not cause ice cream sales
		+ both are caused by third variable summer/heat

### Pearson Correlation
+ correlation between two quantitive variables

+ correlation coefficient r 
	+ describes strength of relation ship between X and Y
	+ r=-1: 
		+ perfect descending linear relationship
		+ high X <==> low Y
	+  0: 
		+ variables not systematically related
		+ high X <==> high or low Y
	+  1: 
		+ perfect ascending linear relationship
		+ high X <==> high Y
+  correlation threshold
	+ threshold depends on domain
	+ different for each use case
+  large population but small sample size
	+ likelihood of correlation within subset
	+ even though no correlation within whole population
	+ null hypothesis

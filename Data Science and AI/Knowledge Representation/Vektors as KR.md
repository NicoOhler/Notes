# Vektors as KR
+ Vectors as numeric, non-symbolic representation of complex entities
+ relevant characteristics have to be chosen
	+ representable as real numbers
	+ ideally easily computable
	+ feature/knowledge-engineering
		+ know what is actually relevant
		+ what questions do we want to ask?
+ Vector operations
	+ identify useful operations in a given use case
	+ 

### Useful questions for Feature Engineering
+ What are similar entities?
+ Which group does an entity belong to?
	+ classification
+ What are meaningful sub-groups?
	+ clustering
+ Is there a correlation between entity characteristics?
	+ correlation
+ Does a characteristic cause another one?
	+ causation
+ Is there a more compact representation?
	+ factor analysis
	+ Which variables carry most information?

### Similarity
+ useful for
	+ recommendation
	+ information retrieval

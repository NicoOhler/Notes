### Shortest Path 
+ determine shortest path between two nodes in grap
+ minimise weight of constituent edges

### Centrality
+ determine most influential nodes in graph
+ different types of centrality depending on use case
+ degree centrality
	+ number of incoming connections
+ closeness centrality
	+ the closer to all other nodes the more central

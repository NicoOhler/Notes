# Information Retrieval
+ r=f(q,D)
	+ r...ranking score
	+ D...set of documents
	+ q...query returns data from document
	+ f....function returns ranking based on query and document
+ ranks documents by relevance
	+ further filtering possible
+ usage:
	+ recommendation systems
	+ search engines
	+ basically all over the web
+ different from [[Data Retrieval]]
	+ hybrid approach possible
+ heavily reliant on user feedback
	+ unlike [[Data Retrieval]]
	+ query refining
		+ user unhappy with results ==>  user changes query
	+ offline evaluation and adaptation of algorithms
	+ online machine learning

### Query formulation
+ content-related queries
+ query by example
	+ upload similar image

1. **What is Epistemology?**:
    - **Definition**: Epistemology is the study of knowledge, focusing on how we know what we know and the justification of true knowledge.
    - **Philosophical Roots**: It has a long history, with contributions from philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, and Kant, who explored how we can know things with certainty.
2. **Deductive Reasoning**:
    - **Hempel-Oppenheim Scheme**: Also known as the deductive-nomological model, it explains scientific reasoning as deriving specific cases from general laws.
    - **Popper's Critique**: Karl Popper argued that empirical verification is impossible due to the potential for exceptions (the "black swan" problem). Instead, he proposed falsification as a way to test scientific theories.
3. **Inductive Reasoning**:
    - **Statistical Reasoning**: Involves generalizing from specific cases to broader laws, often using statistical analysis to predict outcomes with a certain probability.
    - **Applications**: Widely used in natural sciences, medicine, and social sciences to understand causal relationships and correlations.
4. **Criticism of Deductive and Inductive Models**:
    - **Deductive Model**: Criticized for assuming known laws and not explaining how they are discovered. It is often counterfactual, as exceptions exist in many sciences.
    - **Inductive Model**: Faces issues like false positives/negatives and lacks a philosophical foundation. It is pragmatic but not always applicable to individual cases.
5. **The Sociological Turn**:
    - **Shift in Focus**: From philosophical reasoning to empirical studies of scientific practices. It emphasizes credibility over certainty and examines how scientific knowledge gains acceptance.
    - **Laboratory Studies**: Focus on what scientists actually do, how they persuade each other, and how scientific controversies are resolved.
6. **Contemporary Approaches**:
    
    - **Diverse Methods**: Includes deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, hermeneutical approaches, constructivist models, and practical reasoning in engineering.
    - **Open Debate**: There is no single conclusive answer, and epistemology remains an open field with ongoing discussions about the best ways to understand and justify knowledge.

1. **Deductive vs. Inductive Reasoning**:
    - **Deductive Reasoning**:
	    - Moves from general principles to specific cases.
		- Central to the **Hempel-Oppenheim Scheme** (deductive-nomological model), which emphasizes universal laws and logical consistency.
    - **Inductive Reasoning**:
		- Moves from specific cases to general principles.
		- Common in statistical and empirical research, where conclusions are probabilistic rather than absolute.
2. **The Sociological Turn**:
    - **Shift in Focus**: Moves from philosophical reasoning to empirical studies of scientific practices, emphasizing credibility over certainty.
    + **Science and Technology Studies (STS)**:
		- Investigates how scientific claims gain credibility.
		- Explores how persuasion and institutional structures shape scientific consensus.
3. **Popper's Critique of Inductive Reasoning**:
    - **Black Swan Problem**: Popper argued that empirical verification is impossible because there can always be exceptions (black swans). Instead, he proposed falsification as a method to test scientific theories.
    - **Falsification**: If an exception is found, the supposed law is considered wrong. Until then, it can be assumed correct temporarily.
4. **Criticism of the Deductive-Nomological Model**:
    - **Limitations**: 
		+ Assumes the existence of universal laws, which may not apply in complex sciences like biology, psychology, and meteorology.
	    - Struggles with uncertainty and exceptions that arise in real-world cases.
    - **Inductive and Probabilistic Nature**: 
		- Most scientific research is not strictly deductive but relies on statistical models.
		- Many sciences incorporate a mix of inductive and deductive reasoning.

1. **Deductive vs. Inductive Reasoning**:
    - **Deductive Reasoning**:
	    - Moves from general principles to specific cases.
		- Central to the **Hempel-Oppenheim Scheme** (deductive-nomological model), which emphasizes universal laws and logical consistency.
    - **Inductive Reasoning**:
		- Moves from specific cases to general principles.
		- Common in statistical and empirical research, where conclusions are probabilistic rather than absolute.
2. **The Sociological Turn**:
    - **Shift in Focus**: Moves from philosophical reasoning to empirical studies of scientific practices, emphasizing credibility over certainty.
    - **STS Approach**: The sociology of scientific knowledge (STS) examines how scientific claims gain credibility and how scientists persuade each other and the public.
3. **Popper's Critique of Inductive Reasoning**:
    - **Black Swan Problem**: Popper argued that empirical verification is impossible because there can always be exceptions (black swans). Instead, he proposed falsification as a method to test scientific theories.
    - **Falsification**: If an exception is found, the supposed law is considered wrong. Until then, it can be assumed correct temporarily.
4. **Criticism of the Deductive-Nomological Model**:
    - **Limitations**: The model presupposes the existence of known laws and focuses on applying them to specific cases. It struggles with exceptions, which are common in many sciences.
    - **Inductive and Probabilistic Nature**: Most scientific research is inductive and probabilistic, relying on statistical models rather than strict deductive reasoning.

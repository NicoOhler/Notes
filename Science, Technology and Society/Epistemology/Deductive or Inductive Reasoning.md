1. **Overview of Epistemology**:
    - **Definition**: Epistemology is the study of knowledge, focusing on how we justify and know things with certainty.
    - **Philosophical Roots**: It explores foundational questions about the nature of knowledge and its justification, with a focus on scientific knowledge.
2. **Deductive vs. Inductive Reasoning**:
    - **Deductive Reasoning**: Involves reasoning from general principles or laws to specific cases. It is central to the Hempel-Oppenheim Scheme, also known as the deductive-nomological model, which emphasizes logical consistency and universal laws.
    - **Inductive Reasoning**: Involves reasoning from specific cases to general principles. It is often used in statistical analysis to predict outcomes based on observed data.
3. **The Sociological Turn**:
    - **Shift in Focus**: Moves from philosophical reasoning to empirical studies of scientific practices, emphasizing credibility over certainty.
    - **STS Approach**: The sociology of scientific knowledge (STS) examines how scientific claims gain credibility and how scientists persuade each other and the public.
4. **Popper's Critique of Inductive Reasoning**:
    - **Black Swan Problem**: Popper argued that empirical verification is impossible because there can always be exceptions (black swans). Instead, he proposed falsification as a method to test scientific theories.
    - **Falsification**: If an exception is found, the supposed law is considered wrong. Until then, it can be assumed correct temporarily.
5. **Criticism of the Deductive-Nomological Model**:
    - **Limitations**: The model presupposes the existence of known laws and focuses on applying them to specific cases. It struggles with exceptions, which are common in many sciences.
    - **Inductive and Probabilistic Nature**: Most scientific research is inductive and probabilistic, relying on statistical models rather than strict deductive reasoning.

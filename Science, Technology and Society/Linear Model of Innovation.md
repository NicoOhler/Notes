### Definition: 
+ The **linear model of innovation** proposes that scientific knowledge directly leads to economic growth and addresses social needs through a straightforward, step-by-step process: 
	+ **research → development → pilot plant → scale up  → production  → product development**.
	+ **basic research → applied research → development → production → diffusion**.
- This model assumes a **unidirectional flow** from scientific discovery to technological advancement and economic impact.
### History and Criticism:
- **Origins**: 
	- Popularized in the **mid-20th century**, particularly by U.S. industrialists and policymakers seeking **government funding and recognition** for scientific research.
	- Gained traction through **Vannevar Bush’s 1945 report**, which argued that government investment in science would fuel economic prosperity.
- **Criticism**:
	- **Empirical Flaws**:
	    - The model oversimplifies the complex nature of innovation, ignoring factors such as **feedback loops, trial and error, and non-linear development paths**.
	    - Innovation rarely follows a strict sequence—unexpected discoveries and market needs often influence research priorities.
	- **Statistics & Social Construction**:
	    - The model’s **quantifiability** has contributed to its persistence; policymakers favor it because it offers measurable metrics for funding allocation.
	    - However, **historical analyses** suggest that many major innovations arose **independently of directed scientific research**.
### Implications:
- **Economic & Policy Influence**:
    - **Commercialization of Science**: The model reinforces the idea that research should have immediate economic benefits, potentially undermining **curiosity-driven or fundamental research**.
    - **Policy Frameworks**: Many science and innovation policies are structured around this model, even though it fails to capture **real-world innovation dynamics**.
- **Persistence Despite Flaws**:
    - The model aligns well with **economic theories and policy-making agendas**, making it politically and institutionally difficult to replace.
    - The belief that **science should "pay off" economically** remains a strong justification for public funding of research.

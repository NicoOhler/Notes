### Definition: 
+ The linear model of innovation suggests that scientific knowledge directly leads to economic prosperity and meets social needs. It presents a straightforward, step-by-step process from research to application.
### History and Criticism:
- **Origins**: Developed by U.S. industrialists to gain social recognition and government support.
- **Criticism**:
	- **Empirical Flaws**: The model is criticized for being overly simplistic and not accounting for failures or detours in innovation.
	- **Statistics**: The model's success is partly due to its ability to be quantified, even if the numbers don't always support its claims.

### Implications:
- **Economic Focus**: The model promotes the idea that science should be economically beneficial, which can limit pure, curiosity-driven research.
- **Policy Influence**: Despite its flaws, the model persists because it aligns with economic policies and can be easily measured.
### Why It Persists:
- **Numbers and Policy**: The model continues to be used because it fits well with economic theories and policy-making, even if it's not entirely accurate.

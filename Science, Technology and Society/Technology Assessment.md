1. **What is Technology Assessment (TA)?**:
    - **Purpose**: TA aims to evaluate the implications of technology, providing scientific expertise and policy advice to guide decision-making.
    - **Historical Context**: Originated in the U.S. with the Office of Technology Assessment in 1972, and later adopted in Europe.
2. **Conceptual Background**:
    - **Refuting Technological Determinism**: TA challenges the idea that technology follows an inevitable path, emphasizing that it can be shaped by decisions.
    - **Public Engagement**: TA has evolved from expert-centered to more participatory forms, involving wider social groups in the decision-making process.
3. **Participatory Technology Assessment**:
    - **Methods**: Includes citizen juries, round tables, and consensus conferences to engage the public in shaping technology.
    - **Case Study - Asbestos**: Highlights the long history of recognizing health risks and the eventual policy measures taken to regulate its use.
4. **Policy Measures and Stakeholders**:
    - **Regulatory Framework**: Parliaments play a crucial role in creating regulations for technology, considering scientific evidence and public concerns.
    - **Hidden Stakeholders**: Trade conflicts and legal challenges illustrate the complex interplay of interests in technology regulation.
5. **Conclusion**:
    - **Political Nature of Technology**: Technology is inherently political, and its regulation involves deliberation and decision-making by all stakeholders.
    - **Expansion of Policy**: Beyond funding and innovation, science and technology policy now includes public participation and engagement in shaping outcomes.

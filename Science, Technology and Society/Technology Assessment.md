1. **What is Technology Assessment (TA)?**:
    - **Purpose**: TA evaluates the social, economic, and environmental implications of technology, providing scientific expertise and policy advice to guide decision-making.
	- **Historical Context**:
	    - Originated in the U.S. with the **Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) in 1972**.
	    - Later adopted in Europe, where it evolved to include more participatory approaches.
	    - Driven by the need to **anticipate and mitigate unintended consequences** of technological innovations.
2. **Conceptual Background**:
    - **Refuting Technological Determinism**:
	    - TA challenges the notion that technological progress is **autonomous and inevitable**.
	    - Emphasizes that **social, economic, and political decisions** shape technological development.
	- **Public Engagement**:
	    - TA evolved from **expert-centered models** to participatory forms.
	    - Seeks to involve **citizens, stakeholders, and policymakers** in shaping technology.
	    - Helps democratize technology governance.
3. **Participatory Technology Assessment**:
	- **Methods**:
	    - Uses **citizen juries, round tables, and consensus conferences** to engage the public.
	    - Encourages early intervention in technology development rather than reactive regulation.
	- **Case Study - Asbestos**:
	    - Demonstrates how **early warning signs of health risks were ignored** for decades due to economic and industrial interests.
	    - Eventually led to **policy measures banning or restricting asbestos use**, showing the importance of **proactive assessment**.
4. **Policy Measures and Stakeholders**:
	- **Regulatory Framework**:
	    - Parliaments and regulatory bodies **balance scientific evidence, public concerns, and economic interests** in decision-making.
	- **Hidden Stakeholders**:
	    - Trade conflicts, corporate interests, and legal battles often **influence the trajectory of technology regulation**.
	    - Example: **Pharmaceutical patents, nuclear energy policies, and digital surveillance technologies**.
5. **Conclusion**:
    - **Political Nature of Technology**:
	    - Technology is **not neutral**â€”it embodies social values, power dynamics, and economic interests.
	    - Decision-making around technology must be **deliberative, inclusive, and transparent**.
	- **Expansion of Policy**:
	    - Science and technology policy has **expanded beyond funding and innovation**.
	    - Now includes **public participation, ethical considerations, and sustainability assessments**.

### Definition: 
+ Technological determinism is the idea that technology is the main driver of social change. It suggests that technology shapes society in a one-way direction, where technology is the cause and society is the effect.
### Criticism:
- **Dominance**: The belief that technology controls our lives is questioned. Examples include how technology affects traffic, communication, agriculture, and even personal relationships.
- **Problematic Views**:
	- **Mono-causal**: Reducing everything to technology as the sole cause is overly simplistic.
	- **Inevitability**: Claiming there are no alternatives to technological paths is a mistake.
	- **Unidirectional**: Claiming that technology influences society but not vice-versa.
	- **Unintended Uses:** Technology is not always used as the desgin intended.
- **Examples**: The printing press and cotton gin are often cited as technologies that changed the world, but their impacts are more complex than just technological influence.
### Alternative Views:
- **Evolutionary Model**: This model argues that technology does not have a fixed path or inner logic. There are always alternative designs and uses for technology, and users often adapt technology in unexpected ways.

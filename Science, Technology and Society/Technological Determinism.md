### Definition: 
+ Technological determinism suggests that technology is the primary force shaping society, driving historical and social change in a **one-way** direction.
- It implies that technological advancements unfold according to their own internal logic, independent of human intervention.
### Criticism:
- **Dominance**: The assumption that technology controls our lives overlooks human agency and social, political, and economic factors.
- **Problematic Views**:
    - **Mono-causal**: Overlooks other influences such as culture, politics, and economics.
    - **Inevitability**: Suggests that technological progress follows a predetermined path without alternatives.
    - **Unidirectional**: Ignores the fact that society also shapes technology through regulations, market demand, and cultural adaptation.
    - **Unintended Uses**: People repurpose technology in ways designers did not foresee, challenging the idea that technology has an inherent trajectory.
+ **Examples**
	- **The Printing Press**: While often credited with causing the Reformation and modern education, its impact was shaped by societal structures (e.g., literacy rates, religious tensions).
	- **The Cotton Gin**: Accelerated cotton production but also reinforced slavery in the U.S., illustrating that technological impact depends on **social context**.
#### Alternative Views
- **Evolutionary Model**:
    - Technology does not follow a single, inevitable path.
    - Multiple designs and applications compete, and **users play a key role** in shaping technological development.
    - Social, economic, and political factors influence which technologies become dominant.

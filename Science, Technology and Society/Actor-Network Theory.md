### Concept of Technology:
- **Bruno Latour**: Developed and popularized ANT, arguing that technology is not merely a passive tool but an active participant in shaping society.
- **Tool vs. Actor**: Traditionally, technology is viewed as a neutral tool controlled by humans. ANT challenges this by introducing **actants**—both human and non-human elements that influence outcomes.
- **Socio-Technical Configuration**: Technology should not be analyzed in isolation but as part of a **network** of relationships, where it interacts with social, political, and material factors.
### Guns and Agency:
- **Debate**: The question of whether guns (or technology in general) are neutral or inherently influential has been widely discussed.
- **Latour's View**:
    - Humans and technologies do not act independently; their interactions shape behavior.
    - Example: A gun in itself does not kill, and a person without a gun does not have the same capacity to kill. The relationship between the human and the gun creates new possibilities for action.
    - The presence of certain technologies can change the nature of decisions, actions, and social behaviors.
### Berlin Key Example:
- A uniquely designed key that forces users to lock the door before retrieving it from the other side.
- Illustrates how **technology enforces social norms**—in this case, ensuring doors are always locked.
- Demonstrates that technology is not neutral but **shapes and constrains** human behavior.
### ANT's Core Idea:
- - **Networks**:
    - ANT emphasizes that actions arise from **networks of relationships** rather than isolated human decisions.
    - These networks include **humans, technologies, institutions, and practices**.
- **Non-Neutrality**:
    - Since technology is embedded within social structures, it is not neutral.
    - Technologies shape and are shaped by social norms, economic conditions, and power dynamics.
### Criticism of ANT:
- **Overextension and Symmetry**: Critics argue that ANT attributes too much agency to non-human entities, potentially equating human and technological actions. 
- **Lack of Power Analysis**: While ANT focuses on relationships, it does not adequately address how **power and inequalities** shape these networks.
- **Descriptive, Not Prescriptive**: ANT is good at explaining **how things happen** but does not provide clear normative guidelines for change.
### Summary:
- **Technology as a Tool**: The traditional view sees technology as neutral, merely serving human intentions.
- **Technology as an Actor**: ANT argues that technology **actively participates** in shaping actions and outcomes.
- **ANT Perspective**: Actions emerge from **networks** of human and non-human interactions, and technology is deeply intertwined with **social, political, and ethical** structures.

### Concept of Technology:
- **Bruno Latour**: Proposed and popularized this theory.
- **Tool vs. Actor**: Traditionally, technology is seen as a neutral tool that humans use. However, ANT challenges this by suggesting that technology can act as an "actor" within a network, influencing outcomes.
- **Socio-Technical Configuration**: ANT views technology not as an isolated entity but as part of a network of relationships between humans and non-humans (actants).
### Guns and Agency:
- **Debate**: There's a debate about whether guns (or technology in general) are neutral tools or active participants in social dynamics. Some argue guns are neutral, while others believe they inherently influence behavior.
- **Latour's View**: Latour suggests that neither guns nor humans act independently. Instead, it's the relationship between them that matters. This relationship can transform intentions and actions.
### Key Example:
- **Berlin Key**: This example illustrates how technology (a key) and social norms (locking doors) are intertwined. The design of the key and keyhole enforces social behavior (locking the door), showing how technology can embody social norms.
### ANT's Core Idea:
- 
- **Networks**: ANT emphasizes the importance of networks, where both human and non-human elements interact. Understanding these networks is crucial to understanding how technology and society influence each other.
- **Non-Neutrality**: In ANT, technology is not neutral because it is part of a network that shapes and is shaped by social interactions.
### Summary:
- **Technology as a Tool**: In one view, technology is a neutral tool used by humans.
- **Technology as an Actor**: In another view, technology can act and influence outcomes.
- **ANT Perspective**: ANT suggests that technology and humans are part of a network, and their interactions are what drive actions and outcomes. This network is not neutral, as it involves complex interdependencies.

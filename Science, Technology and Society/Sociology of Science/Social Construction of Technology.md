1. **Understanding Technological Change**:
    - **SCOT Framework**: Proposes that technology development is a social process, influenced by how problems are defined and who defines them.
    - **Case Study - Bicycles**: Examines the development of the safety bicycle, showing that technological success depends on social context and user groups.
2. **Interpretative Flexibility**:
    - **Concept**: Different social groups interpret and use technologies in various ways, meaning that technology does not have a fixed or inherent logic.
    - **Example**: The high-wheeler bicycle was initially dominant, but the safety bicycle eventually prevailed due to changing user preferences and contexts.
3. **Social Closure**:
    - **Process**: After a period of dispute and controversy, a phase of social closure occurs where a particular technology becomes stabilized and widely accepted.
    - **Closure Types**: Rhetorical closure involves persuasive communication, while performative closure is based on demonstrated performance advantages.
4. **Summary of SCOT**:
    - **Technological Development**: Viewed as a social process where the definition of problems and solutions is influenced by social groups.
    - **No Inherent Logic**: Technology's design and success depend on social perspectives and interactions, not on an inherent technological logic.

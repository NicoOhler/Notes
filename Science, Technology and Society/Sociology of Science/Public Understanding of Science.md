1. **Purpose of PUS**:
    - **Origin**: Emerged from a funding crisis in the 1980s, particularly in the UK, where governments cut funding for scientific research.
    - **Problem**: There was a perceived lack of public understanding and appreciation of science, leading to declining student numbers in STEM fields and public controversies over issues like BSE (mad cow disease) and GMOs.
2. **The Bodmer Report (1985)**:
    - **Findings**: Highlighted low levels of public knowledge about science and its significance.
    - **Conclusions**: Advocated for science popularization and dissemination to improve public understanding.
    - **Criticism**: The report was criticized for focusing only on textbook knowledge and for instrumentalizing the public to serve scientists' interests.
3. **The Deficit Model**:
    - **Features**: Assumes the public lacks scientific knowledge and that scientists should provide the correct information.
    - **Implications**: This model excludes laypeople from decision-making and reinforces scientists' authority, framing critical views as ignorance.
4. **Learning from Controversies**:
    - **GMO Experience**: Highlighted the negative impact of public protests and the need for more constructive public engagement.
    - **Public Engagement**: Emphasizes dialogue and early involvement of the public in the research process, acknowledging practical knowledge and experiences.
5. **Role of the Media**:
    - **Background**: In a neoliberal model, scientists compete for funding and public support through media engagement.
    - **Media Logic**: Media frames issues for sensation and controversy, which can influence public perception and scientific communication.
    - **Consequences**: While media can mobilize support, it can also lead to loss of credibility if warnings are overstated or if expert disagreements erode trust.

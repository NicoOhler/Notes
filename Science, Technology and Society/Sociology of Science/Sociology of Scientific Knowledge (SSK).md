1. **Overview of Sociology of Science**:
    - **Focus**: The sociology of science examines how science is conducted in practice, the norms guiding scientific conduct, how controversies are resolved, and how scientific truth claims gain credibility.
    - **Classical Literature**: Key figures include Robert Merton, Harry Collins, and David Bloor, each contributing to our understanding of scientific norms and knowledge.
2. **The Sociological Turn**:
    - **Shift in Questions**: Moves from philosophical questions about certainty to sociological questions about scientific practice.
    - **Science in Practice**: Studies how scientists conduct research, the norms they follow, and how they resolve controversies.
3. **Robert Merton's Norms**:
    - **The Normative Structure of Science**: Merton outlined technical and social norms that guide scientific conduct.
    - **CUDOS Norms**:
        - **Communism**: Science is a communal activity for the common good.
        - **Universalism**: Science should be free from discrimination based on ethnicity, religion, gender, etc.
        - **Disinterestedness**: Science should be driven by curiosity, not personal profit.
        - **Organized Skepticism**: Critical scrutiny and mutual criticism are essential for truth-seeking.
	1. **Criticism of Merton's Norms**:
	    + Presents an idealized, outdated image of science that does not reflect contemporary practices.
		- Modern science often involves patenting, commercialization, and personal profit, deviating from Mertonâ€™s ideals.
4. **Sociology of Scientific Knowledge (SSK)**:
    - **Beyond Merton**: SSK challenges Merton's idealism by asking tougher questions about scientific knowledge.
    - **Collins on Controversies**: Studies how scientific controversies are resolved, emphasizing the role of social factors like status and reputation in determining which claims are accepted.
5. **The Strong Programme (David Bloor)**:
    - **Symmetry Principle**: Proposes that both true and false knowledge claims should be explained using the same sociological principles.
    - **No Exceptions**: All types of knowledge, including mathematics and natural sciences, can be explained sociologically.
    - **Empirical Studies**: Demonstrate how scientific facts emerge from social processes rather than purely objective discovery.
6. **Epistemological Shift**:
    - **From Certainty to Credibility**: Moves from philosophical arguments about certainty to understanding the social circumstances that make knowledge claims credible.
    - **Sheila Jasanoff's Civic Epistemology**: Credibility arises from:
		- Contestation and debate.
		- The reputation and institutional affiliations of knowledge producers.
		- Inclusivity of different perspectives in knowledge production.
7. **Relevance and Impact**:
    - **Collective Decision Making**: The sociology of science informs policy advice and societal decision-making by examining how scientific knowledge gains credibility.
    - **Public Discourse**:
		- Highlights the importance of critical engagement with media.
		- Warns about the challenges posed by conspiracy theories and fake news.
    - **Understanding Disciplines**: Provides insights into how knowledge claims are made and accepted within scientific communities.

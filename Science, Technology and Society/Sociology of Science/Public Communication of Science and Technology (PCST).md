### **Definition and Scope**
- **PCST** is an **interdisciplinary research field** that focuses on making **specialized scientific knowledge accessible to the public**.
- It explores **how science and technology (ST) affect society and how society, in turn, shapes ST**.
- Examines the **public perception of science and technology**, including **trust, misinformation, and societal impact**.
### **Why the Media Matters in PCST**
- **Media plays a central role in shaping public discourse** on science and technology.
- Helps in **detecting emerging scientific issues**, tracking their **evolution and controversies**.
- Differences exist between **media representations** and **scientific perspectives**, influencing public understanding and policy-making.
#### **Key Media Channels**
- **Newspapers** (traditional but valuable due to access, long-term coverage, and editorial filtering).
- **Social Media** (platforms like X, Reddit, and YouTube influence public opinion and misinformation).
- **Other formats** (vlogs, podcasts, online forums).
### **Media Monitoring and Automation**
- **Objective**: Develop **automated tools** to track and analyze how science and technology are represented in media.
- **Techniques used**:
    - **Information Retrieval (IR)**: Structuring, storing, and retrieving scientific information from large datasets.
    - **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Extracting meaning from texts to track trends and sentiments.
### **Challenges in PCST & Digital Data**
- **Dataset Collection**: Selecting **relevant articles and distinguishing science-focused content** from general media.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: A structured process involving:
    1. **Collect**: Gather data from news articles, RSS feeds, social media, and online archives.
    2. **Deduplicate**: Remove redundant content using **hashing techniques**.
    3. **Enrich**: Apply **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** to extract key terms (scientists, institutions, technologies).
    4. **Index**: Store in databases like **MongoDB and Elasticsearch**.
    5. **Analyze**: Identify **trends, risk indicators, and thematic patterns**.
### **Case Study: Public Debate on AI**
- **Comparing AI coverage across different countries and media channels** (e.g., newspapers vs. social media).
- **Construction of multilingual datasets** to analyze how AI is framed in public discourse.
- **Topic Modeling** applied to detect recurring themes (e.g., ethics, risks, opportunities).
### **Workflow Support for PCST Research**
- **Filtering & Search**: Using **Boolean queries and regular expressions** to refine results.
- **Tracking Changes in Language Over Time**: Monitoring **how scientific terms evolve** in media discussions.
- **Quantitative & Qualitative Approaches**: Combining **big data analytics with expert interpretation**.
### **Tools and Systems Used**
- **Historical Media Access**: Europeana, NewsEye, Impresso.
- **Monitoring Systems**: NOAM, European Media Monitor.
- **Data Analysis Tools**: CorText, Knime, Orange Data Mining.

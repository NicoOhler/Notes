1. **Purpose of PUS**:
    - **Origin**: Emerged from a funding crisis in the 1980s, particularly in the UK, where governments cut funding for scientific research.
    - **Problem**: There was a perceived lack of public understanding and appreciation of science, leading to declining student numbers in STEM fields and public controversies over issues like BSE (mad cow disease) and GMOs.
    - **Response**: Scientists pushed for better communication of science to the public, emphasizing its societal importance.
2. **The Bodmer Report (1985)**:
    - **Findings**: Highlighted low levels of public knowledge about science and its significance.
    - **Conclusions**: Advocated for science popularization and dissemination to improve public understanding.
    - **Criticism**: 
	    - Focused too much on textbook knowledge, ignoring contextual understanding and engagement.
		- Instrumentalized the public for scientists' interests (e.g., securing funding and political support).
		- Implicitly assumed that more knowledge would lead to greater public acceptance of science.
3. **The Deficit Model**:
    - **Features**: Assumes the public lacks scientific knowledge and that scientists should provide the correct information.
    - **Implications**: 
	    -  Excludes laypeople from decision-making, reinforcing scientists' authority.
		- Frames critical views as ignorance rather than alternative perspectives or legitimate concerns.
	- **Criticism**:
		- Fails to recognize the legitimacy of lay knowledge and public concerns.
		- Neglects the role of trust, values, and institutional credibility in public attitudes toward science.****
4. **Learning from Controversies**:
    - **GMO Experience**: Highlighted the negative impact of public protests and the need for more constructive public engagement.
    - **Public Engagement**:
		- Advocates for dialogue-based approaches rather than one-way communication.
		- Encourages early involvement of the public in the research process (upstream engagement).
		- Recognizes the value of experiential and practical knowledge from non-scientists.
5. **Role of the Media**:
    - **Background**: In a neoliberal model, scientists compete for funding and public support through media engagement.
    - **Media Logic**: Media frames issues for sensation and controversy, which can influence public perception and scientific communication.
    - **Consequences**:
		- Can mobilize public and political support for science.
		- However, overstated warnings and visible expert disagreements can lead to loss of credibility and trust in science.
		- Science loses its monopoly over knowledge-making as alternative sources of information (including misinformation) gain traction.

1. **Understanding Resistance**:
    - **Public Involvement**: Over time, the public has shifted from passive admiration of science and technology (post-war-techno-optimism) to active participation in decision-making processes, especially regarding regulation.
    - **Cultural Context**: The 1970s saw a rise in protest culture, challenging many societal norms, including those related to science and technology. Issues like civil rights, gender equality, and environmentalism were at the forefront.
2. **Contested Technologies**:
    - **Examples**: Nuclear power, reproductive technologies, and information technologies were among those contested due to concerns about health, privacy, and power dynamics.
    - **Recombinant DNA**: Raised public concerns about safety and long-term effects, leading to calls for regulatory measures.
3. **Constructive Turn**:
    - **Alternative Technologies**: There was a push to develop alternative technologies, particularly in energy, and to involve users as agents of change.
    - **Citizen Science**: Encouraged public participation in scientific knowledge production.
    - **Regulations**: Established safety standards. 
1. **Science and Society Relationship**:
    - **Shift in Dynamics**: The relationship between science and society has evolved, with increased public engagement and debate over the benefits and autonomy of science.
2. **Dealing with Controversies**:
    - **Communication and Participation**: Emphasized the need for better communication to improve transparency, public understanding and acceptance, and for creating spaces for public engagement.

1. **Understanding Resistance**:
    - **Public Involvement**:
	    - The **post-war era** was marked by optimism about technological progress, but by the **1970s**, skepticism grew.
	    - Resistance often emerged from concerns about **health, ethics, power imbalances, and environmental consequences**.
	- **Cultural Context**:
		- Social movements (civil rights, feminism, environmentalism) influenced resistance to certain scientific and technological developments.
2. **Contested Technologies**:
    - **Examples**:
	    - **Nuclear Power**: Raised safety concerns (e.g., Chernobyl, Three Mile Island).
	    - **Reproductive Technologies**: Sparked debates on ethics, gender, and medical authority.
	    - **Information Technologies**: Privacy concerns, digital surveillance, and corporate control over data became major points of contention.
	- **Recombinant DNA**:
	    - Raised public concerns about safety and long-term effects.
	    - Led to **self-regulation** within the scientific community (e.g., Asilomar Conference) and eventual **governmental oversight**.
3. **Constructive Turn**:
	- **Alternative Technologies**:
	    - A push for decentralized, sustainable, and community-driven technologies (e.g., **renewable energy, open-source software**).
	- **Citizen Science**:
	    - Enabled **non-experts to contribute to research** (e.g., environmental monitoring, medical research).
	- **Regulations**:
	    - Shifted towards **precautionary principles**, requiring industries to prove safety before widespread adoption.
4. **Science and Society Relationship**:
    **Shift in Dynamics**:
	- Science is no longer viewed as purely objective and autonomous; instead, its development is shaped by **political, economic, and cultural factors**.
	- Scientists must engage with the public to **gain credibility and legitimacy**.
#### Dealing with Controversies
- **Communication and Participation**:
    - The **deficit model** (assuming the public simply needs more education) has been **replaced by engagement models** that emphasize dialogue.
    - Transparency, participatory decision-making, and **public trust** are key to resolving scientific controversies.

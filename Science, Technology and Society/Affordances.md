### Definition:
- Affordances refer to the "multifaceted relational structure" between objects (technology) and their use, which encourages or discourages certain behaviors.
	- Interplay of tech efficacy and human agency
	- Objects afford but do not determine.
	- Technology creates conditions that make certain actions
		- easier/harder
		- less/more likely
- Affordances describe the **relational structure** between objects (technology) and their use, shaping possible actions.
    - Affordances do not **determine** behavior but influence (afford) it.
    - Technology enables or constrains actions without outright dictating them.
    - Technologies create conditions that make certain actions:
        - **Easier or harder**
        - **More or less likely**
### Social and Political Dimensions:
- **Technologies Are Not Just Tools**: They embody **social values**, ethics, and interests.
- **Power and Politics**:
    - Design choices reflect and reinforce **societal structures**.
    - Affordances influence **accountability, fairness, and access**.
### Relation to [[Actor-Network Theory]]:
- **Networks**: ANT focuses on how humans and technologies form **interdependent networks** where both influence each other.
- **Symmetry (Latour’s View)**: ANT proposes a **symmetrical** approach, treating human and non-human actants as having **equal influence** in a network.
- **Asymmetry and Power (Davis’s View)**:
    - While ANT emphasizes symmetry, affordances recognize the **asymmetry of power**—humans have **agency**, but artifacts have **efficacy** (they enable or constrain behavior).
    - Some users (e.g., corporations, governments) have more control over technological systems than others.
### Integration of Concepts:
- **Co-Constitutive Relationship**: Both affordances and ANT highlight that humans and technology are co-constitutive, meaning they shape each other.
- **Asymmetry and Power**: While ANT suggests symmetry, affordances recognize the need for asymmetry to account for power dynamics and human responsibility. Humans have agency, while artifacts have efficacy.
### Beyond [[Technological Determinism]]:
- **Influence, Not Determination**:
    - Technologies shape behaviors but do not rigidly determine them.
    - People **appropriate, repurpose, or resist** technological affordances.
- **Contextual Variability**:
    - The **effects of technology change** based on the **social, cultural, and historical** context.
    - Users often subvert intended uses (e.g., hacking, modding, unintended uses of social media).
### Examples and Implications:
- **Hostile Design**:
    - Park benches with dividers prevent **homeless people from sleeping**.
    - Anti-skateboarding devices discourage use by certain groups.
    - Demonstrates **how affordances can be used to exclude** specific populations.
- **Unpredictable Use**:
    - **Social Media**: Originally designed for networking, later used for activism, misinformation, and surveillance.
    - **Hashtags**: Initially a tool for organization, later used for political movements (#MeToo,#BlackLivesMatter ).
### Summary:
- **Human-Technology Interplay**: Both affordances and ANT emphasize the 
	- **mutual shaping** of humans and technology.
- **Political and Power-Laden**: Human-technology relations are inherently political and power-laden, with technology reflecting and shaping societal structures.
+ **Open and Dynamic**: Technology use is flexible and evolves over time, sometimes in ways unintended by designers.

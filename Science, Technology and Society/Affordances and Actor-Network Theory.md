### Affordances (Jenny Davis):
- **Definition**: Affordances refer to the "multifaceted relational structure" between objects (technology) and their use, which encourages or discourages certain behaviors.
	- Interplay of tech efficacy and human agency
	- Objects afford but do not determine.
	- Technology creates conditions that make certain actions
		- easier/harder
		- less/more likely
- **Social Dynamics**: Technologies are not just tools; they are social in nature. They embody ethics, values, and interests, influencing how people interact with them.
- **Power and Politics**: Technological design can reflect and shape societal structures, impacting fairness, accountability, and transparency.
### [[Actor-Network Theory]]:
- **Networks**: ANT emphasizes the interconnectedness of humans and technology, forming networks where both actants (humans and non-humans) influence outcomes.
    - **Symmetry**: Latour argues for a symmetrical relationship between humans and technology, where both have the capacity to cause effects.
### Integration of Concepts:
- **Co-Constitutive Relationship**: Both affordances and ANT highlight that humans and technology are co-constitutive, meaning they shape each other.
- **Asymmetry and Power**: While ANT suggests symmetry, affordances recognize the need for asymmetry to account for power dynamics and human responsibility. Humans have agency, while artifacts have efficacy.
### Beyond [[Technological Determinism]]:
- **Influence, Not Determination**: Technologies do not determine actions but influence them by enabling, constraining, or encouraging certain behaviors.
- **Contextual Variability**: The effects of technology vary across different contexts, and users often find creative or subversive ways to use technology.
### Examples and Implications:
- **Hostile Design**: Examples like park benches with armrests or anti-skateboarding devices show how design can enforce social norms or exclude certain groups.
- **Unpredictable Use**: Technologies often have multiple uses, some of which are unforeseen by their designers, highlighting the dynamic interplay between design and use.
### Summary:
- **Human-Technology Interplay**: Both affordances and ANT emphasize the complex interplay between technological efficacy and human agency.
- **Political and Power-Laden**: Human-technology relations are inherently political and power-laden, with technology reflecting and shaping societal structures.
- **Open and Dynamic**: Technologies are not static; they evolve with human interaction, leading to varied and sometimes unexpected outcomes.

1. **Political Context**: Technologies are developed and used within specific political and social contexts, which can affect their neutrality.
2. **System Compatibility**:
    - **Nuclear vs. Solar Energy**: Some technologies, like nuclear energy, may be more compatible with certain political systems (e.g., totalitarian regimes) than others, like solar energy, which might align better with democratic societies.
3. **Examples**:
    - **Internet and Democracy**: The internet can promote democracy but also be subject to government control and surveillance.
    - **Open Science**: Encourages transparency and sharing, but requires specific political and legal conditions to thrive.
4. **Summary**: Technologies are not neutral because their compatibility with political systems affects their use and impact. The political context shapes how technologies are developed and implemented.

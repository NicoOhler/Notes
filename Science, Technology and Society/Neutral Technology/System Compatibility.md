+ **Political Context**: Technologies are developed and used within specific political and social contexts, which can affect their neutrality.
+ **System Compatibility**:
    - **Nuclear vs. Solar Energy**: Some technologies, like nuclear energy, may be more compatible with certain political systems (e.g., totalitarian regimes) than others, like solar energy, which might align better with democratic societies.
    - **Some Technologies Reinforce Political Structures**: Not just about whether some technologies fit better with political systems, but also about whether certain technologies actively shape and reinforce political structures (e.g., nuclear technology requiring high levels of state control and secrecy).
+ **Examples**:
    - **Internet and Democracy**: The internet can promote democracy but also be subject to government control and surveillance.
    - **Surveillance and Control**: The internet’s dual role—both as a tool for democracy and as a means for state surveillance—illustrates that technology is always shaped by power structures.
    - **Open Science**: Encourages transparency and sharing, but requires specific political and legal conditions to thrive.
- **Neoliberal Influence**: The dominance of economic thinking in technological development leads to prioritization of profit-driven technologies, often at the expense of social or environmental considerations.
+ **Summary**: Technologies are not neutral because their compatibility with political systems affects their use and impact. The political context shapes how technologies are developed and implemented.

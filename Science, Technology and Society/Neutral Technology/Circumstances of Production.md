+ **Production Matters**: The conditions under which technology is produced affect its neutrality. Social and environmental factors during production can influence the technology itself.
+ **Examples**:
    - **Cotton T-shirts**: Often produced under poor working conditions with environmental hazards.
    - **Fair Trade and Fairphone**: These initiatives aim to produce goods responsibly, highlighting the importance of production conditions.
+ **Environmental and Social Costs**: Technologies like mining for lithium have significant environmental and social impacts, often benefiting a few while harming local communities.
+ **Legal Protections & Economic Pressures**: Not just social and environmental conditions, but also legal protections (or lack thereof) for workers, safety regulations, and economic pressures influence technologyâ€™s neutrality.
+ **Summary**: Technologies are not neutral because the circumstances of their production matter. Ignoring these factors overlooks important social and environmental effects.

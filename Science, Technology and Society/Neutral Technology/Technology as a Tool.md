### Definition:
+ The idea of technology being neutral suggests that technology itself doesn't have inherent effects; it's just a tool that can be used in various ways.
### Argument Against Neutrality:
- **Non-Neutral Effects**: Technology is not neutral because it can have specific social effects. For example, the design of technology can influence who has access to it and who benefits from it.
- **Case Study**: The bridges designed by Robert Moses in New York were too low for buses, effectively excluding people without cars (often marginalized groups) from certain areas. This suggests that technology can have political implications.
- **Design and Access**: Technologies like keys, locks, and digital rights management can restrict access and control usage.
- **Inclusion and Exclusion**: Technologies can either include or exclude people based on their design and implementation.
- **Prevention and Encouragement**: Technologies may encourage or discourage certain behaviors.
### Summary: 
+ Technology is not neutral because it can influence social behavior and power relations. The way technology is designed and used can have significant social implications.

### Overview
+ represent logic statements
+ structure consisting of nodes/vertices and edges
	+ edges and nodes can have labels
		+ labelled graph
		+ unlabelled graph
	+ edges can have direction
		+ directed graph
		+ undirected graph
+ some knowledge can be well represented as graph
+ further details [[Graphentheorie]]

### Adjacency Matrix
+ represents distance/adjacency between all nodes of a graph

### Use Cases
+ Shortest Path 
	+ determine shortest path between two nodes in grap
	+ minimise weight of constituent edges
+ Centrality
	+ determine most influential nodes in graph
	+ different types of centrality depending on use case
	+ degree centrality
		+ number of incoming connections
	+ closeness centrality
		+ the closer to all other nodes the more central

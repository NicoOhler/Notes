### Basic Idea
+ add hardware to handle multiple instructions truly parallel
	+ fetch multiple instructions simulatenously
	+ schedule [[Multi-Cycle Execution]]

+ superscalar pipeline for each CPU core
+ bottle neck
	+ slow memory access
	+ single memory access could take hundreds of CPU cycles
	+ solution: [[Caching]]

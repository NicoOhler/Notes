### Overview
+ ![[../../../z_images/Pasted image 20221112165957.png]]
+ each instruction takes one cycle to execute
	+ maximum [[Clock Frequency]] defined by slowest instruction

### Performance
+ goal to maximise instruction executions per time
+ determined by
	+ clock cycles per instruction CPI
	+ [[Clock Frequency]], cycles per second
+ program with N instruction takes $N*CPI*(1/f)$

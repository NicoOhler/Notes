### Clock Frequency Limitations of [[Combinational Circuits]]
+ limited by the time it needs to compute its outputs
+ bottleneck is path with longest propagation delay
	+ defines maximum clock rate

### Impact of Temperature
+ high temperature => slower [[Transistors]]
+ overclocking CPU
	+ might produce more heat
	+ slowdown might lead to uncompleted computations
	+ processor crashes

### Clock cycles
+ time divided in discrete slices
+ clock period
	+ time between two rising clock edges

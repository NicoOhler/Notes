	+ LSB at lowest address
+ big endian
	+ MSB at lowest address

### Building Memory
+ standard flip flops, decoders and multiplexer would be expensive
	+ able to write/read value to each FF in each cycle
	+ not necessary for most memory
+ single port to read/write memory
	+ read/write one cell at a time

### Definition
+ remote on-demand servers to host, store, manage and process data
	+ stored as [[Distributed Data Storage]] in [[Data Center]] instead of own locally hosted servers

### Service Models

### Benefits
+ pay as you go
	+ no upfront cost
	+ pay per use or aquired resources
	+ variable utilization
		+ prevents having too many/not enough ressources
		+ ![](Pasted%20image%2020220609180508.png)
+ economies of scale
	+ purchasing IT infrastructure at scale ==> lower cost
		+ hardware as well as IT infrastructure know-how
	+ focus on scale-out HW over scale-up ==> lower cost
+ elasticity
	+ flexiblity on resource demand
	+ work for 10 days on 1 nodes ==> 1 day on 10 nodes

	+ assuming perfect scalability
		+ ![](Pasted%20image%2020220609180820.png)
		+ 5% not parallelizable ==> max speed up 20x
		+ 25% not parallelizable ==> max speed up 4x

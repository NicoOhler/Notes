### Neuromorphic Hardware
+ inspired by the human brain
+ optimized brain computations which are
	+ sparse and spike-based
	+ asynchronous 
		+ without the need for clock signal
	+ independent and parallel
	+ local 
		+ i.e. everything needed is stored nearby
	+ energy efficient 
		+ e.g. our brain operates at ~20W and produces nearly no heat
+ improves upon Von Neumann architecture
	+ bottleneck due to data transfer over central bus
	+

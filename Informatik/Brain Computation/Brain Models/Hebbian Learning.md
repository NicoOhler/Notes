+ theory for long term [plasticity](../Neurons/Plasticity.md) 
	+ if cell A repeatedly takes part in causing cell B to fire
	+ then the synaptic efficacy of A on B increases
	+ i.e. presynaptic spike before postsynaptic spike increases synaptic weight
+ fails to take depression into account
+ unidirectional
+ spike timing dependent plasticity STDP
	+ relative spike timing $\Delta_t=t_{post}-t_{pre}$ 
	+ $\Delta_t$ determines sign and magnitude of weight change
	+ usually $\Delta_t>0 \Rightarrow$ potentiation

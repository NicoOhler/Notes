### Motivation
+ dendrites impact [neurons](../Neurons/Neurons.md) via spatiotemporal filtering and active effects
	+ are neuromodulators meant with active effects?
	+ neurons extend spatially
		+ dendrites more than 99% of neuron's surface
	+ different compartments connected to different brain regions
	+

### Multi-Compartment models
+ idea
	+ divide dendrites into small cylindric volumes
	+ use separate [Hodgkin-Huxley Model](Hodgkin-Huxley%20Model.md) for each
	+ electrically connected and conductance between them
+ multiple abstraction levels down to point neuron model
	+ very realistic modeling of individual neurons
		+ ~200 compartments
		+ parameters fit to recordings
	+ simpler models use one compartment per branch

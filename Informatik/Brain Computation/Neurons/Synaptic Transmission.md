### Transmission Sequence for Chemical Synapses
1. action potential arrives at presynaptic terminal (axon end)
2. depolarization open $Ca^{2+}$ channels
3. $Ca^{2+}$ enters presynaptic terminal and triggers synaptic vesicles 
	+ containers full of neurotransmitter cocktails
4. synaptic vesicles fuse with membrane
	+ neurotransmitters released into synaptic cleft
5. diffusion with [Ion Channels](Ion%20Channels.md) on postsynaptic side
6. postsynaptic conductance change causes postsynaptic current 
	+ $I_{syn}(t)=-g_{syn}(t)(u(t)-E_{syn})$ 
	+ excitatory (e.g. glutamate) or inhibitory effect (e.g. GABA)
7. current causes postsynaptic potential
	+ $C_m\frac{du}{dt}=-g_{L}(u(t)-u_{rest}) + I_{syn}(t)$ 

###  Dale's principle
+ neurons perform same chemical action at all their outgoing synapses
+ thus neurons either excitatory or inhibitory

### Stochastic Neurotransmitter Release
+ probability depends on pre/postsynaptic factors such as
	+ recent activity
	+ long term [Plasticity](Plasticity.md)
	+ homeostasis
+ multiple release sites per synapse
	+ $\Rightarrow$ postsynaptic potential varies
	+ synaptic weight = average
+ fast but short lasting effect on single neuron
	+ via transmission of action potential
	+ like a single additional signal
### Release of Neuromodulators
+ chemicals regulating neuron properties
	+ excitability
	+ plasticity
+ difference to neurotransmitter
	+ slow but long lasting effect on a whole neuron area widespread, non-local

### Synaptic Plasticity
+ synaptic efficacy changes over time 
	+ i.e. high firing frequency may lead to higher/lower postsynaptic amplitudes
+ change depends on local information
	+ pre/postsynaptic spike train
	+ stochasticity
	+ neuromodulators

### Short Term Plasticity
+ change last a few milliseconds
+ recovers afterwards
+ different per [synapse](Synapses.md) behavior based on neuron type
	+ depression reduces PSP amplitudes
	+ facilitation increases PSP amplitudes
	+ mixed usually an increase followed by a decrease
+ 

### Long Term Plasticity
+ change last hours to days
+ divided into
	+ potentiation LTP
	+ depression LTD

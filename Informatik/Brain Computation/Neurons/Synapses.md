### Electrical Synapses
+ common throughout the brain
+ neglected in most [brain models](../Brain%20Models/Brain%20Models.md)
+ electrical transmission via gap junctions
	+ i.e. connection between two membranes
+ transmission characteristics
	+ bidirectional
		+ neurons influence each other
	+ rapid, basically instantaneous
	+ continuous and independent of action potential?
		+ strong coupling and synchronization?
### Chemical Synapses
+ common throughout the brain and used by most models
+ electrical signal from axon causes chemical transmission at synapse which causes electrical signal at dendrite
+ slow, unidirectional transmission
	+ presynaptic activity influences postsynaptic neuron
+ see [Synaptic Transmission](../Plasticity/Synaptic%20Transmission.md)

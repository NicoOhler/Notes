### Electrical Synapses
+ common throughout the brain
+ neglected in most [Brain Models](../Brain%20Models/Brain%20Models.md)
+ electrical transmission via gap junctions
	+ i.e. connection between two membranes
+ transmission characteristics
	+ bidirectional
		+ neurons influence each other
	+ rapid, basically instantaneous
	+ continuous and independent of action potential?
		+ strong coupling and synchronization?

### Chemical Synapses
+ common throughout the brain and used by most models
+ electrical signal from axon causes chemical transmission at synapse which causes electrical signal at dendrite
+ slow, unidirectional transmission
	+ presynaptic activity influences postsynaptic neuron
+ 
+ Dale's principle
	+ neurons perform same chemical action at all their outgoing synapses
	+ thus neurons either excitatory or inhibitory
+ neurotransmitter release is stochastic
	+ probability depends on pre/postsynaptic factors such as
		+ recent activity
		+ long term [Plasticity](Plasticity.md)
		+ homeostasis
	+ multiple release sites per synapse
		+ $\Rightarrow$ postsynaptic potential varies
		+ synaptic weight = average
+ neuromodulators
	+ chemicals regulating neuron properties
		+ excitability
		+ plasticity
	+ difference to neurotransmitter
		+ alters neuron properties instead of sending them signals
		+ slow but long lasting
		+ widespread, non-local

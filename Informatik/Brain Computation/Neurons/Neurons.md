### Structure
+ soma
	+ cell body
	+ generates output action potential based on inputs
	+ responsible for actual [[../Computation/Computation]]
+ [Dendrites](Dendrites.md)
	+ deliver input currents to the soma
	+ connected to axons of other neurons via [Synapses](Synapses.md)
+ axons
	+ relay output action potentials to other neurons
	+ spikes generated in axon hillocks
		+ they connect axons to soma
### Communication
+ via [Spike Generation](Spike%20Generation.md) and action potential
+ resting potential is potential at which no signals are sent
+ fluids in and outside of the neuron cell
	+ which contain ions (charged atoms)
	+ act as capacitance (charge storage)
+ membrane separates these fluids
	+ acts as resistor with low conductance
	+ causes membrane potential
		+ electrical potential difference across a cell's membrane
+ receive currents via dendrites
+ [Ion Channels](Ion%20Channels.md) through membrane
	+ ions flow through them and cause electrical current

### In Vivo Stochasticity
+ neurons by themselves are entirely deterministic
+ stochasticity arises from synaptic bombardment
	+ many, many inputs with variable membrane potentials
	+ modeled as [Poisson](../../../Mathematik/Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie/Wahrscheinlichkeitsverteilungen/Poisson%20Verteilung.md) background noise

### Ions
+ atoms with positive or negative charge
+ common types
	+ sodium $Na^+$
	+ potassium $K^+$
	+ calcium $C^{2+}$
	+ chloride $Cl^-$
+ move because of 
	+ diffusion
		+ stochastic movement due to [thermodynamics](../../../../Mathematik/Physik/Phys-ETTE-Thermodynamik_2017.pdf)
		+ from low to high concentration regions 
		+ only affects ions of same type
	+ electrical forces
		+ opposite charges attract due to [electromagnetism](../../../../Mathematik/Physik/40-Phys-ETTE-Elektrizitaet-Magnetismus-2022.pdf)
		+ attraction strength proportional 
			+ variable potential
			+ fixed conductance
		+ anions (negative) move towards positive regions
		+ cations (positive) move towards negative regions
		+ affects all ions no matter the type
	+ equilibrium potential $E$
		+ potential at which these two forces cancel each other
		+ $I=-g(u-E)=0$
			+ controls how quickly equilibrium is reached
		+ $E_{ion}$ different for each ion type
			+ computable via Nernst equation
		+ neuron's resting potential is interplay of all ion types
			+ computable via Goldman equation
			+ $u_{rest}=E_{ion}$ if only one ion type is present
+ different ion concentrations in and outside of [neurons](Neurons.md)
	+ causes potential difference (membrane potential)
### Ion Channels
+ channels which allow ions to pass through the membrane
+ often selective
	+ i.e. only one ion type may pass
+ often gating mechanism
	+ opens and closes if conditions are met
	+ e.g., open if membrane potential above certain threshold

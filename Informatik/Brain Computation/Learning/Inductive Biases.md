+ structural mechanisms which support learning
+ utilize simplifying assumptions
+ reduce search space 
	+ prune impossible solutions
	+ merge equivalent solutions
	+ neglect unlikely solutions
### Examples
+ prefer simplest solutions that still makes sense
	+ great for generalization
	+ reduces cognitive load
	+ drastically speeds up learning
+ brain architecture
	+ modularity
		+ promotes specialization
		+ e.g. recognizing faces
	+ hierarchical processing
		+ extract information from local details 
		+ use/integrate/combine information for a broader understanding
	+ both simplify [credit assignment problem](Brain%20&%20Machine%20Learning.md)
	+ evolution optimized brain to be a good learner
+ temporal coherence
	+ co-occuring features are likely related
### Learning Goal
+ curiosity or imitation?
+ brain architecture biases us towards certain types of learning to
	+ gain an evolutionary advantage and
	+ ultimately increase our survival odds

+ long term [plasticity](Plasticity.md) rule
+ does not rely on bAP
	+ works for cases where [Hebbian Learning](Hebbian%20Learning.md) and [STDP](Spike-Timing%20Dependent%20Plasticity.md) fail
+ relies on postsynaptic depolarization instead
	+ small depolarization $\Rightarrow$ depression
	+ large depolarization $\Rightarrow$ potentiation

+ best learning rule so far still far from perfect due to
	+ neuromodulators
	+ point neuron assumption
	+ rapid plasticity without postsynaptic activity

+ long term [plasticity](../Synapses%20&%20Plasticity/Plasticity.md) rule
+ does not rely on bAP
	+ works for cases where [Hebbian Learning](Hebbian%20Learning.md) and [STDP](../Synapses%20&%20Plasticity/Spike-Timing%20Dependent%20Plasticity.md) fail
+ relies on postsynaptic depolarization instead
	+ small depolarization $\Rightarrow$ depression
	+ large depolarization $\Rightarrow$ potentiation

### Synaptic Plasticity
+ synaptic efficacy changes over time 
	+ i.e. high firing frequency may lead to higher/lower postsynaptic amplitudes
+ change depends on local information
	+ pre/postsynaptic spike train
	+ stochasticity
	+ neuromodulators
### Short Term Plasticity
+ change last a few milliseconds
+ recovers afterwards
+ different per [synapse](Synapses.md) behavior based on neuron type
	+ depression reduces PSP amplitudes
	+ facilitation increases PSP amplitudes
	+ mixed usually an increase followed by a decrease
+ gives rise to
	+ novelty detection
		+ i.e. only react to change
	+ low/high pass filter of spike trains
	+ stabilization of network dynamics
		+ i.e. prevent infinite growth and complete silence

### Long Term Plasticity
+ change last hours to days
+ divided into
	+ potentiation LTP
	+ depression LTD
+ e.g. 
	+ [STDP](Spike-Timing%20Dependent%20Plasticity.md) according to [Hebbian Learning](Hebbian%20Learning.md)
	+ [Clopath Learning](Clopath%20Learning.md) relies on membrane depolarization instead of bAP
	+ [Reinforcement Learning](Reinforcement%20Learning%20in%20the%20Brain.md) uses neuromodulators as learning signal

	+ rapid plasticity without postsynaptic activity
	+ ...

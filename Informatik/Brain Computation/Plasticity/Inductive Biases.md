+ structural mechanisms which support learning
+ reduce search space
	+ prune impossible solutions
	+ merge equivalent solutions
	+ neglect unlikely solutions
+ via simplifying assumptions
	+ prefer simplest solutions that still makes sense
		+ great for generalization
		+ reduces cognitive load
		+ drastically speeds up learning
	+ brain architecture
		+ modular brain 
			+ promotes specialization
			+ e.g. recognizing faces
		+ hierarchical brain
			+ extract information from local details 
			+ use/integrate/combine information for a broader understanding
		+ both simplify [credit assignment problem](Brain%20&%20Machine%20Learning.md)
		+ evolution optimized brain to be a good learner
	+ nearest neighbor for KNN
+ learning goal
	+ curiosity or imitation?
	+ brain architecture biases us towards certain types of learning to
		+ gain an evolutionary advantage and
		+ ultimately increase our survival odds

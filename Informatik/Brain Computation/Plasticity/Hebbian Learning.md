+ theory for long term [plasticity](../Plasticity/Plasticity.md) 
	+ if cell A repeatedly takes part in causing cell B to fire
	+ then the synaptic efficacy of A on B increases
	+ i.e. presynaptic spike before postsynaptic spike increases synaptic weight
+ fails to take depression into account
+ unidirectional
+ Hebbian rule
	+ $\frac{d}{dt}w_{ij}=\eta v_iv_j$
+ utilized by [[Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity]]

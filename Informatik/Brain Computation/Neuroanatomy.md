### Basics
+ core of the nervous system
+ connected via spinal cord to peripheral nervous system
	+ i.e., the remaining body (muscles, sensors, actors)
+ consists of ~86 billion [Neurons](Neurons/Neurons.md)
	+ interconnected via [Synapses](Neurons/Synapses.md)
+ weighs ~1.5 kg 
+ volume ~2000 cmÂ²
+ different regions and parts of the brain associated with different functionalities
### General Structure
+ cerebrum
	+ outer layer called cerebral cortex
		+ "Gehirnrinde"
		+ mainly somas
		+ grey matter
		+ newer neocortex
			+ 90% of cortex
			+ 6 layers
		+ older allocortex
			+ 10% of cortex
			+ 3-4 layers
	+ inner subcortical area
		+ mainly axons
		+ white matter
	+ further division into
		+ frontal lobe
		+ parietal lobe
		+ temporal lobe
		+ occipital lobe
+ cerebellum
+ brain stem

### Brain Stem
+ connects brain with the spinal cord
	+ thus also to the remaining nervous system/body
+ regulates vital body functions
	+ breathing
	+ heart rate
	+ ...
### Cerebellum
+ responsible for motor coordination and muscle control
### Subcortical Areas
 + mostly responsible for various less cognitive functions
	 + motoric, emotions, connections, ...
+ amygdala
	+ emotion control
	+ emitting neurotransmitters and hormones based on emotion
		+ e.g., emission of cortisol under stress for heightened awareness 
	+ increasing memory formation under strong emotional load
+ thalamus
	+ connects cerebrum and midbrain
	+ acts as relay station for sensory inputs
+ hypothalamus
	+ coordination of vital functions
	+ regulates water, salt, body temperature, ...
+ hippocampus 
	+ responsible for memory formation and spatial cognition (orientation)
	+ located in temporal lobe, right below cortex and strongly connected to it
### Cortex
+ mostly responsible for cognitive functions
	+ thinking, learning, memory, language, ...
+ prefrontal cortex
	+ responsible for planning, decision making, working memory, impulse and emotion control
+ complex with many different neuron types and patterns
	+ mostly regular
	+ i.e. recurring patterns in different regions
+ divides into several functional regions
	+ not well separated though
	+ follows processing hierarchy similar to CNNs

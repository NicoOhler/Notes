+ spike timings contain information
+ extremely "memory" efficient encoding
+ overcomes shortcomings of fire rate analysis
+ latency code
	+ measures time between stimulus and response
	+ small latency indicates strong activation
	+ prevalent for early/initial stimulus
		+ e.g. first touch, sudden change in brightness

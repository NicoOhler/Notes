+ spike timings contain information
+ extremely "memory" efficient encoding
+ overcomes shortcomings of fire rate analysis
+ latency code
	+ measures time between stimulus and response
	+ small latency indicates strong activation
	+ prevalent for early/initial stimulus
		+ e.g. first touch, sudden change in brightness
+ phase code
	+ oscillations occur throughout the brain
	+ analyze firing time within oscillatory phase
		+ do all neurons have to fire within cycle?
		+ strongly activated neurons fire early
		+ similar to a latency code
+ synchrony
	+ information represented by multiple neurons linked if they fire synchronously

+ biologically plausible [brain models](Brain%20Models/Brain%20Models.md) are hard to interpret
+ can we learn from regular [Machine Learning](../Machine%20Learning/Machine%20Learning.md) instead?
	+ ANNs also hard to interpret
+ differences between ANNs and the brain
	+ brain and ANNs are both deep networks of simple, identical units
	+ ANNs are slow learners, need tons of examples, humans fast

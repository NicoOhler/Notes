+ biologically plausible [brain models](Brain%20Models/Brain%20Models.md) are hard to interpret
+ can we learn from regular [Machine Learning](../Machine%20Learning/Machine%20Learning.md) instead?
+ relation between ANNs and the brain
	+ brain and ANNs 
		+ overparameterized networks of simple, identical units
		+ hard to interpret
		+ perform well due to powerful learning algorithms
		+ sometimes use similar representations e.g. CNNs
	+ ANNs are slow learners, need tons of examples, humans fast
	+ ![](../../z_images/Pasted%20image%2020250618222057.png)
+ inductive biases
	+ bias towards simple solutions which make sense
	+ great for generalization
	+ what is the brain's objective function? learning mechanism? how is credit assigned?

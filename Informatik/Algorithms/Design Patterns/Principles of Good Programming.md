### SOLID
+ Single Responsibility
	+ class should have exactly one reason to change??
	+ small classes with single responsibility
	+ avoid god classes
+ Open Closed
	+ extend class behavior without modification
	+ e.g. inheritance, adapter, strategy
+ Liskov Substitution
	+ derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes
+ Interface Segregation
	+ fine grained, client specific interfaces??
+ Dependency Inversion
	+ depend on abstraction instead of concrete implementations

### Principles of Good Programming
+ Decomposition
	+ makes a large problem more manageable by dividing it into smaller subproblems
	+ divide'n conquer
	+

### SOLID
+ Single Responsibility
	+ class should have exactly one reason to change??
	+ small classes with single responsibility
	+ do one thing and stick to that (Curly's law)
	+ avoid god classes
+ Open Closed
	+ extend class behavior without modification
	+ e.g. inheritance, adapter, strategy
+ Liskov Substitution
	+ derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes
+ Interface Segregation
	+ fine grained, client specific interfaces??
+ Dependency Inversion
	+ depend on abstraction instead of concrete implementations

### Principles of Good Programming
+ Decomposition
	+ makes a large problem more manageable
	+ decomposition into smaller subproblems (single responsibility)
	+ divide and conquer
	+ separate concerns
+ Abstraction
	+ wrap another layer around a problem
	+ hide implementation details
+ Decoupling
	+ reduce dependencies
	+ late binding
	+ shift binding time to later
+ Usability and Simplicity
	+ easy to use right, hard to use wrong
	+ adhere to expectations, intuitive usage

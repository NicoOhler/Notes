### Definition
+ proven and established solution for a reoccurring problem
	+ idea, scheme or template
	+ general and unspecific, suitable for a class of problems
### Purpose
+ efficient and fast since ideas are reused
+ reduces misunderstandings with established terminology
+ easier knowledge transfer
+ increases usefulness of specific ideas by generalizing to different problems
### Format
+ pattern name
+ context
	+ situation in which a problem occurs
+ problem
+ forces
	+ requirements, constraints and challenges
	+ motivating factor
	+ why does the problem hurt in this context
+ solution
	+ generic description of the implementation
	+ describes components and how they interact
	+ structures, behaviors, actionable steps, ...
+ consequences
	+ benefits and draw backs
	+ how are the forces resolved
	+ liabilities, limitations and tradeoffs
+ known uses
	+ real world examples

### Emergence
+ they emerge out of real use cases
+ found instead of invented
+ life cycle
	+ patterns found among multiple solutions/use cases
	+ core idea (pattern) written down
	+ discussion
	+ improvement
	+ publication
	+ repeat discussion after improvement or publication
### Pattern Languages
+ coherent system of patterns
+ involves
	+ patterns
	+ relations
		+ how patterns influence each other
		+ (anti)synergies
	+ principles
		+ guidelines for implementation, combination with other patterns and evolution

### Real World Examples
+ stairs
+ table
+ chair
+ car
+ pen

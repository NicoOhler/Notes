	+ class or object adapter
	+ create a sub class (inherits from adaptee) or wrapper class (contains adaptee) which provides the same functionality as the desired interface and handles the conversion internally
+ Which pattern can be used to encapsulate complex structure in a better interface? Explain how it works.

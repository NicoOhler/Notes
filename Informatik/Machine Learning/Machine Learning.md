### What is Learning
+ long term changes in knowledge, behavior based on experience
+ for humans: 
	+ change in brain structure
+ for machines: 
	+ change in parameters of represented knowledge
		+ [[Artificial Neural Networks]]
	+ structure of KR/formalism changes

### Feedback to Use for Learning
+ unsupervised learning
	+ no explicit feedback
	+ still implicit measure of success
		+ cost/reward function
+ reinforcement learning
	+ rewards or punishments
+ supervised learning	
	+ example input/output pairs given
	+ e.g. [[Classification]]
	+ people are bad at specifying rules but good at giving examples

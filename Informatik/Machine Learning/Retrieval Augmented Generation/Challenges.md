**Relevance Mismatch**: Difficulty retrieving the most relevant documents or passages from a large dataset due to suboptimal ranking or search mechanisms.

**Over-Retrieval**: Retrieving too many documents, leading to unnecessary noise and irrelevant content in the final generation.

**Sparse vs Dense Retrieval Trade-off**: Balancing between sparse retrieval (TF-IDF, BM25) and dense retrieval (using embeddings) to maximise relevance without losing performance.

**Document Question Answering Systems**: With access to proprietary documents, a RAG enabled system becomes an intelligent AI system that can answer all questions about the organisation.

**Latency**: Retrieval from large or distributed knowledge bases can introduce significant delays, affecting real-time applications.

**Cost of Storage**: Maintaining and managing massive vector databases for dense retrieval can be expensive and resource-intensive.

**Narrow Retrieval Focus**: The challenge of retrieving diverse perspectives or sources to ensure that multiple viewpoints or alternative pieces of evidence are surfaced.

**Bias in Retrieval**: Biases in retrieval results based on the structure of the indexed data or retrieval algorithms.

**Context Loss in Long Queries**: Loss of context when handling long, multi-turn queries, leading to disjointed or incomplete answers.

**Incoherent Summarisation**: Generating inconsistent or disjointed summaries from multiple retrieved documents, leading to poor user experience.

**Over-Generation**: Generating overly verbose or redundant responses based on retrieved data that fails to condense the key points effectively.

**Inconsistent Modal Alignment**: Challenges integrating multimodal data where retrieved content across different modalities may not be aligned properly, affecting the quality of the generated response.

**Data Silos**: When knowledge is fragmented across multiple sources or platforms, retrieval becomes challenging due to inconsistent indexing or lack of interoperability between knowledge bases.

**Processing Large-Scale Data**: Difficulty in maintaining high throughput and low latency as the amount of indexed data grows.

**Multi-Agent Coordination**: When multiple agents are used for task orchestration (as in agentic RAG), coordination among agents can become complex and resource-heavy, impacting system efficiency.

**Inefficient Query Routing**: Routing queries to the wrong sources or retrieval pipelines can reduce efficiency.

**Data Poisoning Attacks**: External retrieval sources could be manipulated to feed biased or poisoned data into the generation pipeline, leading to compromised outputs.

**Adversarial Attacks**: Security vulnerabilities where attackers may influence retrieval or generation results by exploiting weaknesses in retrieval pipelines.

**Knowledge Base Updating**: Maintaining an up-to-date knowledge base while keeping the retrieval process fast and accurate can be difficult, especially in dynamic fields like news or finance.

**Memory Retention**: Ensuring that the system can store and retrieve long-term memory across interactions, allowing for a more personalised and context-aware response.

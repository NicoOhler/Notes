### Structure
+ soma
	+ cell body
	+ generates output action potential based on inputs
	+ responsible for actual [[Computation]]
+ [Dendrites](Dendrites.md)
	+ deliver input currents to the soma
	+ connected to axons of other neurons via [Synapses](Synapses.md)
+ axons
	+ relay output action potentials to other neurons
	+ spikes generated in axon hillocks
		+ they connect axons to soma

### Communication
+ via action potential and spikes
+ fluids in and outside of the neuron cell
	+ which contain ions (charged atoms)
	+ act as capacitance
+ membrane separates these fluids
	+ acts as resistor with low conductance
	+ causes membrane potential
		+ electrical potential difference across a cell's membrane

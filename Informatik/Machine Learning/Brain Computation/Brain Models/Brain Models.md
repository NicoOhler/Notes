### Brain Computation
+ computation
	+ mapping inputs to outputs according to algorithm
		+ inputs e.g., stimuli of an image converted into input currents
		+ outputs e.g., response behavior upon understanding of the input and deciding what to do converted into spikes to control muscles
	+ learning may change the program
+ difficult because of
	+ different spatial scales
		+ molecular, cellular, regions, behavior
	+ different temporal scales
		+ activity, [[Plasticity]] ranges from milliseconds to years
	+ many interdependencies
		+ [Neurons](../Neurons.md) are highly interconnected
		+ via [Synapses](../Synapses.md) with different effects
	+ sheer volume	
+ interdisciplinary

### Modeling the Brain
+ computer scientists contribute models and theory for simulation and testing
+ the goal is a better understanding of the brain
	+ generate predictions
	+ test and verify theories
+ approaches with varying levels of abstraction and realism
	+ top-down
		+ start from the psychology side
		+ e.g., cognitivism, probabilistic modeling
	+ bottom-up
		+ start from biology side
		+ e.g., biophysical modeling, connectionism, artificial life

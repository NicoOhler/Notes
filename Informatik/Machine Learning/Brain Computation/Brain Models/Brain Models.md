### Brain Computation
+ computation
	+ mapping inputs to outputs according to algorithm
		+ inputs e.g., stimuli of an image converted into input currents
		+ outputs e.g., response behavior upon understanding of the input and deciding what to do converted into spikes to control muscles
	+ learning may change the program
+ difficult because of
	+ different spatial scales
		+ molecular, cellular, regions, behavior
	+ different temporal scales
		+ activity, plasticity ranges from milliseconds to years
	+ many interdependencies
		+ [Neurons](../Neurons.md) are highly interconnected via [[S]]

### Leaky Integrate-And-Fire Model
+ extreme simple neuron model
+ ![](../../../../z_images/Pasted%20image%2020250616112630.png)
+ 
+ $\tau_m \frac{du}{dt} = -(u(t)-u_{rest}) + R_m I(t)$ with $\tau_m = R_m C_m$

### Derivation
+ Kirchhoff's law with $\sum \limits_j i_j = 0$
	+ $i_C = I(t)   + i_R \im$
+ membrane acts as resistor with $u_R=R i_R$
	+ $i_R = \frac{u_r}{R}$
+ inside fluid acts as capacitance with $i_c=C \frac{du_c}{dt}$

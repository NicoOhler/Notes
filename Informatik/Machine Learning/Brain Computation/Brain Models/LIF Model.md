### Leaky Integrate-And-Fire Model
+ extreme simple neuron model
+ ![](../../../../z_images/Pasted%20image%2020250616111851.png)
+ $\tau_m \frac{du}{dt} = -(u(t)-u_{rest}) + R_m I(t)$ with $\tau_m = R_m C_m$

### Derivation
+ membrane acts as resistor with $U_R=RI_R$
+ inside fluid acts as capacitance with $I_c=C \frac{du_c}{dt}$

+ $F(u)=a_0(u-u_{reset})(u-u_c)$
	+ $u_c\sim\vartheta$ for short current pulse injection
		+ meaning?
+ parabola with roots (intersection with x-axis)
	+ shifted up/downwards depending on $I(t)$
	+ two equilibrium points
		+ stable point
			+ at $u_{rest}$ for $I(t)=0$
		+ unstable point
			+ at $u_{c}$ for $I(t)=0$
	+ no intersection with x-axis causes
		+ potential to always increase followed by a reset
		+ repeated/tonic spiking

+ spikes occur when enough current is injected
	+ large enough magnitude to exceed firing threshold
	+ e.g., via short burst of high current or prolonged low current
+ phasic behavior
	+ interplay with [Ion Channels](Ion%20Channels.md)
	+ regular behavior below the threshold
	+ phases
		+ rise triggered by threshold excess
			+ sodium channels open and cause depolarization (increase in AP)
		+ peak (overshoot)
			+ sodium channels close
			+ potassium channels open and cause repolarization (decrease in AP)
		+ fall
			+ potassium channels remain open
		+ undershoot
			+ potassium channels close
			+ return to resting potential

+ absolute refractory period
	+ additional spikes blocked during
	+ 1-2 ms
+ relative refractory period
	+ less likely to fire during undershoot
+ action potential travels unidirectionally 
	+ wave from one end of the neuron (dendrite, axon) to the other
	+ due to refractory period
+ myelination
	+ protective wrapper around axons
	+ enables faster and more reliable transmission
	+ potential slowly decays during transmission

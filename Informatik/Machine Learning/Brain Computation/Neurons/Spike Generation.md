+ spikes occur when enough current is injected
	+ large enough magnitude to exceed firing threshold
+ phasic behavior
	+ interplay with [Ion Channels](Ion%20Channels.md)
	+ usually 
	+ phases
		+ rise triggered by threshold excess
			+ sodium channels open and cause depolarization 
		+ peak (overshoot)

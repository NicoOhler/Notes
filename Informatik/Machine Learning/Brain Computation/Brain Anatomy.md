### Basics
+ core of the nervous system
+ connected via spinal chord to peripheral nervous system
	+ i.e., the remaining body (muscles, sensors, actors)
+ consists of ~86 billion [Neurons](Neurons.md)
	+ interconnected via [Synapses](Synapses.md)
+ weighs ~1.5 kg 
+ volume ~2000 cmÂ²
+ different regions and parts of the brain associated with different functionalities

### Basics
+ core of the nervous system
+ connected via spinal chord to peripheral nervous system
	+ i.e., the remaining body (muscles, sensors, actors)
+ consists of ~86 billion [Neurons](Neurons.md)
	+ interconnected via [Synapses](Synapses.md)
+ weighs ~1.5 kg 
+ volume ~2000 cmÂ²
+ different regions and parts of the brain associated with different functionalities
### General Structure
+ cerebrum
	+ outer layer called cerebral cortex
		+ "Gehirnrinde"
		+ mainly somas
		+ grey matter
	+ inner layer
		+ mainly axons
		+ white matter
	+ further division into
		+ frontal lobe
		+ parietal lobe
		+ temporal lobe
		+ occipital lobe
+ cerebellum
+ brain stem

### Important Parts of the Brain and their Function
+ brain stem
	+ connects brain with the spinal chord
		+ thus also to the remaining nervous system/body
	+ regulates vital body functions
		+ breathing
		+ heart rate
		+ ...
	+ 
+ cerebellum
	+ responsible for motor coordination and muscle control
+ subcortical areas
	 + mostly responsible for less cognitive functions
		 + motoric, emotions, connections, ...
	+ amygdala
		+ emotion control
		+ emitting neurotransmitters and hormones based on emotion
			+ e.g., emission of cortisol under stress for heightened awareness 
		+ increasing memory formation under strong emotional load
	+ thalamus
		+ connects cerebrum and midbrain
		+ acts as relay station for sensory inputs
	+ hypothalamus
		+ coordination of vital functions
		+ regulates water, salt, body temperature, ...
	+ hippocampus 
		+ responsible for memory formation and spatial cognition (orientation)
		+ located in temporal lobe
+ cortex
	+ mostly responsible for cognitive functions
		+ thinking, learning, memory, language, ...
	+ prefrontal cortex
		+

# Binary Search and Tree
### Binary Search
+ pos = binarySearch(data,key=23)
+ find key position within sorted data

+ optimizations
	+ k-ary search for SIMD data-parallelism
		+ ?
	+ interpolation search: probe  expexted pos in key range
		+ e.g. search for "Bastian" in telephone book, dont start in the middle but rather at the beginning

### Binary Tree
+ self balancing tree
+ individual nodes stored as pages
	+ [[Background Storage System]]
+ each node contains data or reference to data
+ pointer left of value contains

### Benefits
+ pay as you go
	+ no upfront cost
	+ pay per use or aquired resources
	+ variable utilization
		+ prevents having too many/not enough ressources
		+ ![[Pasted image 20220609180508.png]]
+ economies of scale
	+ purchasing IT infrastructure at scale ==> lower cost
		+ hardware as well as IT infrastructure know-how
	+ focus on scale-out HW over scale-up ==> lower cost
+ elasticity
	+ flexiblity on resource demand
	+ work for 10 days on 1 nodes ==> 1 day on 10 nodes
		+ ![[Pasted image 20220609180748.png]]
	+ assuming perfect scalability
		+ ![[Pasted image 20220609180820.png]]
		+ 5% not parallelizable ==> max speed up 20x
		+ 25% not parallelizable ==> max speed up 4x
